# Iceberg Python

Iceberg is a python library for programatic access to iceberg table metadata as well as data access. The intention is to provide a functional subset of the java library.

## Getting Started

The project is not currently deployed to pypi, as such the best way to install the library is to clone this repository and do a local pip install.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:apache/incubator-iceberg.git
cd incubator-iceberg/python
pip install -e .

```
